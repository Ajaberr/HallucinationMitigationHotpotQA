Abstention dataset fields: ['question', 'target', 'short_target', 'original_answer', 'original_id', 'was_correct']
First abstention example:
{'question': "Which magazine was started first Arthur's Magazine or First for Women?", 'target': "Step 1: The question asks which magazine was started first, Arthur's Magazine or First for Women.  \nStep 2: Arthur's Magazine was founded in 1902, while First for Women was launched in 1995.  \nStep 3: Since 1902 is earlier than 1995, Arthur's Magazine was started first. Therefore, the answer is Arthur's Magazine. --> Arthur's Magazine", 'short_target': "Arthur's Magazine", 'original_answer': "Arthur's Magazine", 'original_id': '5a7a06935542990198eaf050', 'was_correct': True}

Verifying dataset alignment (checking first 100 samples)...
✓ All 100 checked questions match perfectly!
✓ Datasets are properly aligned.

Created 10000 training samples
  - Should abstain (abstention dataset says 'I don't know'): 6702 (67.0%)
  - Should answer (abstention dataset has real answer): 3298 (33.0%)

Training policy with REINFORCE + abstention learning (10000 samples)...
Training setup:
  - Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (instruct/finetuned model)
  - Training data: Normal HotpotQA questions + answers
  - NEW REWARD STRUCTURE (learn to abstain when uncertain):
    • Abstention: 0.0 (neutral)
    • Wrong answer: -10.0 (huge penalty)
    • Correct answer: factuality-based (positive)
  - Model learns: Better to abstain (0) than be wrong (-10)
  - KL Penalty: β=0.0 (prevents catastrophic forgetting)
